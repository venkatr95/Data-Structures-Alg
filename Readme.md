This repository contains the implementation of basic Data Structures.

A data structure is a collection of data type 'values' which are stored and organized in such a way that it allows for efficient access and modification. In some cases a data structure can become the underlying implementation for a particular data type.

General data structures:

Linear: arrays, lists, stack, queue
Tree: binary, heaps, space partitioning and other types
Hash: distributed hash table, hash tree and other types
Graphs: decision, directed, acyclic and other types


Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library for the C++ programming language. It provides four components called algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators


Algorithms are mainly used for searching, sorting and partition operations

Linear Search, Binary Search
Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort

Containers stores object or data in terms of container classes

Sequence Containers - Data Structures accessible in sequential manner

 - vector
 - list
 - arrays
 - forward_list

Container Adaptors - Interface for sequential containers

 - queue
 - stack

Associative Containers - Using sorted data structures with less complexity

 - set
 - map
