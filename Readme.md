This repository contains the implementation of basic Data Structures.

A data structure is a collection of data type 'values' which are stored and organized in such a way that it allows for efficient access and modification. In some cases a data structure can become the underlying implementation for a particular data type.

General data structures:

Linear: arrays, lists, stack, queue
Tree: binary, heaps, space partitioning and other types
Hash: distributed hash table, hash tree and other types
Graphs: decision, directed, acyclic and other types
