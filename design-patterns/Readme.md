# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

Main points of a pattern are as follows
 - Intent - It describes the problem statement and goal
 - Motivation - Briefing the problem
 - Structure - Shows the blocks of pattern and relation
